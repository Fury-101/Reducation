{"Unit 1: Kinematics": "Based on the topic of kinematics, here's a question that could challenge a learner's understanding:\n\n\"Given a cart moving with a constant velocity of 5 m/s on a frictionless surface, if the cart is pushed an additional 10 meters, how long will it take for the cart to cover this distance? Explain your answer with relevant equations and assumptions.\"", "Unit 2: Dynamics": "Based on your study of Unit 2: Dynamics, please explain in your own words how the concepts of potential energy and kinetic energy relate to each other during an object's motion. Provide an example of a real-life situation where an object's potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.", "Unit 3: Circular Motion and Gravitation": "Based on your study of circular motion and gravitation, if a planet orbits the sun in an elliptical orbit, which of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation are demonstrated during this motion? Explain your answer in detail, using specific examples from the textbook or course materials if possible.", "Unit 4: Energy": "Based on your study of Unit 4: Energy, please explain in your own words:\n\n1. What is the difference between potential and kinetic energy?\n2. How does the law of conservation of energy apply to a system?\n3. Describe the process of converting potential energy into kinetic energy using an example.\n4. What are the main forms of renewable energy and how do they work?\n5. Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.", "Unit 5: Momentum": "Based on your study of momentum, please explain how the principle of conservation of linear momentum applies during a perfectly elastic collision between two objects. In your response, include the definitions of mass, momentum, and elastic collision, as well as the description of how the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision.", "Unit 6: Simple Harmonic Motion": "Based on your study of Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), please explain the relationship between the amplitude, frequency, and period of a SHM wave. Provide an example using specific values for each variable.", "Unit 7: Torque and Rotational Motion": "Based on your study of Unit 7: Torque and Rotational Motion, please explain the relationship between torque, angular acceleration, and the moment of inertia. Provide an example of how these concepts are interconnected in a real-world situation.", "Unit 8: Waves": "Based on your study of Unit 8: Waves, please explain the following:\n\n1. What are the two main types of waves and how do they differ in their wave motion?\n2. Describe the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and wave speed.\n3. How does the shape of a wave's crest or trough relate to the amplitude of the wave?\n4. What is the role of a medium in wave propagation, and can waves travel through a vacuum?\n5. Explain how energy is transferred through a wave.\n6. Describe the properties of transverse and longitudinal waves, and give an example of each.\n7. How does the Doppler effect change the observed frequency of a wave, and in what situations does it occur?"}
