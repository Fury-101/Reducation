Objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors of the objects.\n\nThe fundamental concepts of OOP include:\n\n1. Encapsulation: This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, and only allowing access to them through public methods. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.\n2. Inheritance: This is the ability of one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and simplifies the development of complex systems.\n3. Polymorphism: This is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were the same class, making it easier to write generic code.\n4. Abstraction: This is the practice of exposing only the necessary information to the outside world, while hiding the implementation details. This helps to simplify complex systems and make them easier to understand.\n\nOOP is a powerful programming paradigm that is widely used in the development of large and complex software systems. It promotes code reuse, simplifies development, and makes it easier to write maintainable and scalable code.", "1.2 - Applications of [Object Object]": "I'd be happy to help explain the applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Data Mining, a subtopic of Data Science.\n\nMachine Learning Algorithms play a crucial role in Data Mining by enabling computers to learn patterns and make predictions from large datasets.

The new class is called the \"derived\" or \"subclass,\" and the existing one is the \"base\" or \"superclass.\" The derived class inherits all the properties and methods of the base class, which saves time and effort in coding.\n\nThe derived class can also add new properties and methods or modify the existing ones. This leads to a hierarchical class structure, where classes can be related to each other in a parent-child relationship.\n\nFor example, consider a base class \"Animal\" with properties like \"name\" and \"color,\" and methods like \"eat\" and \"sleep.\" A derived class \"Dog\" can inherit these properties and methods and add new ones like \"bark\" and \"fetch.\"\n\nInheritance helps in code reuse, reduces redundancy, and simplifies the class hierarchy. It also enables polymorphism, where a base class reference can point to an object of a derived class, allowing the use of derived class methods on the base class reference.\n\nIt's important to note that inheritance should be used judiciously, as it can lead to complex class hierarchies and potential issues like the \"Diamond Problem\" or \"Fragile Base Class\" problem.
