Among these concepts, limits play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of functions at critical points.\n\nIn calculus, a limit is the value that a function approaches as the input (or variable) gets arbitrarily close to a certain value, but does not necessarily equal that value. For instance, consider the function f(x) = 1/x. As x approaches 0, the value of the function does not have a finite value, but rather approaches infinity. In this context, we say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is infinity, denoted as lim x->0 f(x) = \u221e.\n\nLimits help us determine the behavior of functions at critical points, such as discontinuities, and can be used to define derivatives and integrals.

A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input (or variable) gets arbitrarily close to a certain value, but does not necessarily equal that value.\n\nThere are several important properties of limits that are essential to understand:\n\n1. Limits are commutative: If the function f(x) has a limit L as x approaches a, then the limit of g(x) = f(x) as x approaches a is also L, where g(x) is any function for which the limit exists.\n2. Limits are transitive: If the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, and the limit of g(x) as x approaches a is M, then the limit of h(x) = f(x) + g(x) as x approaches a is L + M (similarly for subtraction, multiplication, and division).\n3. Limits and constant functions: If f(x) is a constant function, then the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to the constant value.\n4. Limits and the squeeze theorem: If f(x) \u2264 g(x) \u2264 h(x) for all x close to a, and if the limits of f(x) and h(x) as x approaches a are known and equal to L, then the limit of g(x) as x approaches a is also L.\n5.

In other words, as the input gets larger or smaller without bound, the output gets arbitrarily close to the asymptote but never equals it. For example, the function f(x) = 1/x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, meaning that as x approaches 0 from any side, the value of f(x) gets arbitrarily large.\n\nLimits at infinity, on the other hand, describe the behavior of a function as the input goes to positive or negative infinity. For instance, the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches positive infinity is the value that f(x) approaches as x gets larger and larger. Similarly, the limit of a function as x approaches negative infinity is the value that f(x) approaches as x gets smaller and smaller.\n\nAsymptotes and limits at infinity are essential in calculus to understand the behavior of functions, particularly in the context of infinite series, integrals, and differential equations.
